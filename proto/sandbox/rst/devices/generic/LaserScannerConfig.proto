/**
 * Defines the configuration of a planar laser scanner like devices
 * inside an environment.
 *
 * The rays of the scanning device originate from the origin of a single
 * coordinate system. The rays lie in the X-Y plane defined by the
 * coordinate system and value readings are produced starting at @ref
 * .angle_start to @ref .angle_end. These angles are specified in
 * counter-clockwise fashion around the Z-axis and an angle of 0 points
 * in the direction of the Y-axis. This means that for a symmetric scan
 * to the "front" of the scanner (ie. pointinng in the direction of the
 * y-axis) @ref .angle_start has a negative value and @ref .angle_end is
 * @ref .angle_start * -1.
